bitcoin-widget is a simple OSX dashboard widget that displays data from these sources:

 - Mt. Gox USD
 - Mt. Gox CAD 
 - Mt. Gox EUR
 - Coinbase USD
 - Bitstamp USD
 - BTC-e USD

## Sources

If you'd like to see more data sources added than what is currently available, please open an issue with the name and API URL for the source. Pull requests are welcomed.

## Installation

.wdgt files are available on the [releases](https://github.com/interstateone/bitcoin-widget/releases) page to install directly onto your Dashboard.

## Development

Open the project in Dashcode, select Run & Share in the left sidebar and click the Deploy to Dashboard button. Dashcode is available from the [Downloads for Apple Developers](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action) page. It's free of charge but an Apple Developer account is required.

Dashcode will fail to launch normally as of OS X 10.9 Mavericks. It's still possible to launch it by navigating to `Dashcode.app/Contents/MacOS/` and double clicking on the Dashcode executable, but there are other issues that remain.
